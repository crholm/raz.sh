  In this blog post, I explore how certain design and typography choices, often recommended for improving readability for individuals with dyslexia, can actually enhance the reading experience for everyone. I delve into the benefits of using clear, sans-serif fonts like Lexend, Open Sans, or Noto Sans, which are designed for screen legibility and distinct character shapes. Furthermore, I discuss the significant impact of thoughtful spacingâ€”including adjustments to letter spacing, word spacing, line height, and paragraph spacingâ€”on overall text clarity.

## TL;DR

People with dyslexia have difficulties reading text. Many of the techniques
used to improve readability. Proper fonts, text shaping, spacing, and
layout are actually just good practice for all users, not just those with
dyslexia.

**For the web**

```css
p {
    /* Use sans serif fonts designed for screen readability. 
       Lexend is specifically designed for readability and to 
       reduce visual stress. Verdana and Arial are widely 
       available sans-serif fonts also known for good 
       legibility. */
    font-family: "Lexend", Verdana, Arial, sans-serif;

    /* Increase letter spacing (tracking) to prevent letters
       from appearing too crowded, which can improve 
       readability for some users. 0.1ch provides a noticeable 
       but not excessive increase. */
    letter-spacing: 0.1ch;

    /* Increase spacing between words to help distinguish them
       more clearly. Similar to letter-spacing, this can aid 
       readability. 0.2ch adds a small amount of extra space. */
    word-spacing: 0.2ch;

    /* Set the line height (leading) to increase the space 
       between lines of text. A value of 1.5em (or 150%) is 
       commonly recommended for better readability, as it 
       prevents lines from being too close together */
    line-height: 1.5em;

    /* Add space below each paragraph to improve the separation 
       between blocks of text, making the overall page easier to 
       scan and read. 2em provides a clear visual break. */
    margin-bottom: 2em;

    /* Limit the maximum width of paragraphs to 75 characters, 
       which is a common recommendation for comfortable reading. 
       This can help prevent text from stretching too far and 
       making it difficult to track lines. */
    max-width: 75ch;
}
```

## Intro

I have dyslexia and received my diagnosis way back in the early 90s, before
it was widely recognized or understood. My teachers' reaction was
typically: "I don't really know what that is. Why can't you just sit down
and read?" probably confusing it with ADHD or other conditions. My parents
were quite insistent on getting me a diagnosis so I could receive the help
that my dad never received when he was growing up.

To be honest, by the time I started high school, I had developed strategies
to handle learning, reading, and writing (painful as it was for both me and
my parents), and I haven't really perceived it as a disability or
disadvantage since.

Looking back, it was probably advantageous that I chose to become an
engineer instead of an MD, where the first years of university involved
mostly mathematical textbooks. ðŸ˜„

## Symptoms

There are quite a few symptoms associated with dyslexia, but the major ones
are:

- Difficulty reading and writing text, with letters and words seeming to
  jump around
- Difficulty spelling words, often spelling the same word differently each
  time

There are also some positive traits that seem more common in people with
dyslexia, such as high IQ and good abstract reasoning and thinking. And
some mostly inconsequential traits, such as having a hard time telling left
from right. (I still check for a scar I have, on my left hand, every time I
need to distinguish left from right. My 4-year-old seems better at this
than I most of the time.)

## Reading

This post focuses specifically on the reading challenges of dyslexia,
particularly on screens. As dyslexia has become more widely recognized,
more accessibility tools and research on the topic have emerged.

For example, there are specialized fonts like those at opendyslexic.org and
dyslexiefont.com that are specifically designed to be readable by people
with dyslexia. These fonts focus on making characters as distinct as
possible, anchoring each character to the same imaginary line, emphasizing
the bottom of the character, enlarging openings, eliminating serifs, and
increasing spacing.

While I do find these fonts make reading easier for me, especially
dyslexiefont.com, I personally think they look rather unappealing. They're
not something I would willingly use myself or force upon any users.

## Takeaways

Looking at the research, there are some clear patterns that can be used to
improve the reading experience for users with dyslexia. These patterns
likely represent good practice for all users, not just those with dyslexia,
as they generally increase readability.

### Fonts

Opt for sans-serif fonts ("sans" means without the small decorative strokes
at the ends of characters) as they are generally considered more
screen-friendly. Look for fonts with distinct character shapes to prevent
confusion between similar letters, and those that provide a clear, stable
baseline for the text. Many widely available sans-serif fonts can
significantly improve readability without compromising aesthetics.

Some good examples are:

- **Lexend**
  [fonts.google.com/specimen/Lexend](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lexend)  
  This font family was specifically designed with the goal of improving
  reading comprehension and reducing visual
  stress [lexend.com](https://lexend.com)
- **Open Sans**
  [fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans)  
  A humanist sans-serif known for its open letterforms and excellent
  legibility.
- **Noto Sans**
  [fonts.google.com/specimen/Noto+Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Noto+Sans)  
  Part of a Google project to create a harmonious look and feel across all
  languages, Noto Sans is designed for clarity.

```css 
p {
    font-family: "Lexend", Verdana, Arial, sans-serif;
}
```

#### Font Size

Once you've selected a suitable font family, setting an appropriate font
size is crucial. A common recommendation for body text is around 1.2rem (
1.2 times the root element's font size, which is often the browser's
default of 16px). This results in paragraph text of about 19px, offering
good readability.

```css 
p {
    font-size: 1.2rem;
}
```

#### Paragraph Width

Beyond font choice, the width of your text blocks significantly
affects readability. If lines of text are too wide, it becomes challenging
for the eye to track from the end of one line to the beginning of the next.
This can lead to fatigue, reduced reading speed, and difficulty
comprehending the content.

Personally, if lines stretch too far, especially when I'm tired, it becomes
almost uncomfortable due to the amount of focus needed to read the text.
This is why I get so frustrated with Gmailâ€”it has been around for 20+ years
and they still haven't implemented a reasonable max-width for messages.

The optimal line length for comfortable reading is generally considered to
be between 45 and 75 characters per line.

```css
p {
    max-width: 75ch;
}
```

### Spacing

Thoughtful use of spacing can significantly impact readability, especially
for individuals with dyslexia. When letters and lines are too close
together, text can appear as a dense block, making it difficult to
distinguish individual words and track lines. Increasing spacing creates
visual breathing room, allowing the eye to move more easily across the
text.

#### Letter Spacing (Tracking)

As mentioned in the TL;DR, increasing letter spacing (also known as
tracking) can be beneficial. Aim for an increase of around 30% of the
average character width.

```css 
p {
    /*0.1ch - 0.3ch*/
    letter-spacing: 0.1ch;
}
```

#### Word Spacing

Increasing the space between words can also improve readability. When words
are too tightly packed, it can be harder to identify word boundaries,
leading to misreading and slower comprehension. A slight increase in
word-spacing can make a noticeable difference.

```css 
p {
    /* 0.1ch - 0.5ch*/
    word-spacing: 0.2ch;
}
```

#### Line Height (Leading)

Adequate line height (or leading) is crucial for comfortable reading. When
lines of text are too close, the eye can easily jump to the wrong line,
disrupting reading flow. A line height of at least 1.5 times the font
size (line-height: 1.5em) is a good starting point. For even better
readability, especially for longer blocks of text, you might consider
slightly increasing this value.

```css 
p {
    /*1.5em - 2em*/
    line-height: 1.5em;
}
```

#### Paragraph Spacing (Margins)

Creating visual separation between paragraphs helps readers process
information in manageable chunks. Adding margin below paragraphs (
margin-bottom) provides this necessary whitespace.

```css
p {
    margin-bottom: 2em;
}
```
