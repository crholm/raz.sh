title: "Building a Website with Raz"
---

## Background

15 years ago when i was in university VMs where all the rage and docker were still some years our. If you wanted to put something on the web, there were basically two options. You could use a shared hosting service for a PHP website, like one.com, or you could rent a VM from a hosting provider and run it your self.

Today i see some of my colleges coming out from university and get right into working on a very high abstraction, docker, kubernetes, serverless, react etc. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but it is easy to miss out on how things actually work where the abstractions "protects" you from having to think about the network, the vms the server and so on. 

The other day I overheard question being asked from a dev, "How do i create a website and how do I get it online?". Mind you this is a person who has been working with web development and are very competent and gets around very well in or stack.

## The Plan

Lets build a blog web site, write a post about the process and put it online.

## Fist things first

We need a domain name! most projects starts of with an idea and a domain being bought, and the end up never used. Its a right of passage and expect 1/2 of the domains you buy to never be used :).

Domain names are bought through a domain registrar, and there are many to choose from. Some prominent are Cloudflare, GoDaddy and Namecheap and for this project i chose the latter. 
I went to [namecheap.com](https://namecheap.com/) and bought the domain `raz.sh`. I like short domain names and this one is perfect for a personal blog.

## Lets build

Alright, so lets not fall in to the trap of having our domain collect dust in the corner. Lets build a website.

I won't do through the entire build here. Instead i'll link to the repo, [github.com/crholm/raz.sh](https://github.com/crholm/raz.sh)

There are however a few things I want to go through here, the basic idea, the architecture amd things that might not be so obvious if you are working high up the abstraction usually.

### The basic idea

The service shall read markdown files from a directory and render them as blog posts, it shall also have a SQLite database to handle some extra metadata and it shall be written in Go

This is nothing new in any way about this project, instead this is somewhat of a rite of passage for devs, to write your own blogging tool.

### Architecture
We want this to be as close to the metal as we can, so we will try bundle everything into one binary and use no extra stuff such as docker, nginx cloud and so on.

The checklist

- Dir with markdown files
- SQLite database
- Go web server
- HTML templates
- CSS / js
- HTTPS/TLS and letsencrypt
